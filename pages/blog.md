## Lessons learned From My First Hackathon

Before my foray into the world of software, I imagined a hackathon to be an event entirely inaccessible to the general public and where a secret handshake might have been necessary to gain entrance. I imagined behind these locked doors the event would be something in between the mission control center in Housten and a massive Dungeons and Dragons tournament. However, as my overall understanding of developers and the software community grew I became more and more excited about attending one.

Finally my chance came at the first official ![Code For Foco](codeforfoco.org) "Hack the Dot" sponsered by Name.com. Although this was a fairly informal hackathon where the objective was more good times than it was producing a solution, I was surprised to find the experience significantly enlightening in regards to teamwork, problem solving, and rapid product development.

My expectation of the objective was confirmed when the host announced that the judging criteria were **creativity** and **humour**. Then the prize domain was announced as FocoTrain.ninja and we were off. With only 90min to produce something presentable, many of us were anxious to begin working but we wisely allowed some time for brainstorming.

We asked good questions, like what are they looking for? What will our competition look like? Etc.

We decided to go the unconventional route and rewrote our url as FocoTrainin Ja which led us to Jamaica.

At that point we just picked a topic: can you take a train to Jamaica. And started building.

I left this experieince feeling that hackathons are not only a super fun way to practice some working with teammates and completing a project under the gun, but that they can teach valuable lessons in project management and general problem solving techniques. I beleive that most people (not just developers) could value greatly from participating in events like this no matter how short or silly and I for one look forward to attending many more myself.
