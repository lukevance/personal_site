title: About Me
---
Growing up in Central Asia gave me a unique perspective which has fueled my love of challenges that force me to think differently and practice creativity. I am passionate about social enterprises and energy innovation and before gSchool I ran my own solar energy startup. Although, it was an unsuccessful endeavor I learned immensely from the failure and look forward to using my experience in the importance of validated learning and rapid iteration to influence my future work at a fast paced technology company.
