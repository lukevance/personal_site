Timeline Trivia takes the monotony out of history trivia. No one liked memorizing dates in grade school, but it is helpful to know that the French Revolution came after The Declaration of Independence. The premise for this game is simple, two events appear on screen: pick the one that came first. You can play single player for a high score or head-to-head in two player.

**Tech Notes:** *Vanilla Javascript, jQuery, HTML/CSS*
